    <h1>Art of Living Course (Part I) </h1>
	<p>The degree to which stress unduly influences our lives is generally underestimated: Often the mind clings on to anger, guilt, or regret about the past, or is plagued by anxiety and worry about the future. This oscillation of the mind causes tension and stress both for ourselves and for the people around us and leads to reduced effectiveness in action. Breath is the link between body and mind, and thus is the key to handling our mind and negative emotions, and releasing our true potential - at work, at home, and at leisure.</p>
	     
	     <p>Course elements include:</p>
	     <ul>
	     
		 <li>Practical knowledge to deal with the daily challenges of life</li>
		 <li>Interactive exercises</li>
		 <li>Yoga, stretching, and relaxation exercises</li>
		 <li>Meditation and powerful breathing techniques</li>
		 <li>Sudarshan Kriya, a unique breathing technique</li>
	     
	     </ul>
	     <p>Just some of the benefits course graduates mention:</p>
	     <ul>
	     
		 <li>Reduced stress</li>
		 <li>More joy and enthusiasm</li>
		 <li>Improved efficiency and productivity (at work and at home)</li>
		 <li>Greater self-esteem</li>
		 <li>Enhanced health and sense of well-being</li>
		 <li>Improved interpersonal skills</li>
		 <li>Clearer perception and decision-making</li>
		 <li>Shining expression and enhanced beauty</li>
		 <li>Anti-aging or rejuvenating effects </li>
	     
	     </ul>

       <h1>Peace</h1>  
       
       <cite>"The past years have been very challenging in the world scenario.
       We have seen a number of agitations flaring up almost everywhere. It is easy to create an agitation
       in today&#39;s society. The frustration & stress levels are high. Any just cause
       can flare up emotions and get people onto the streets.
       
       However, it is a much more challenging and skillful task to create inner
       peace and have people stand up in a peaceful, non-violent and happy mode to
       work towards collective, constructive action.</cite><cite>
       
       The Art of Living has made a humble effort all over the world where millions
       of people have stood up for change in this direction. Today, I am happy that
       people are embracing meditation as well as acknowledging the role of inner peace in nation building."
       
       - Sri Sri Ravi Shankar </cite>
       
       <p>Since its inception in 1981, the Art of Living&#39;s founder, Sri Sri Ravi
       Shankar has been engaged in a peace mission. Here, in The Art of Living Foundation,
       spirituality gives strength and responsibility to serve society. The passion and
       energy stem from the realisation of the need for peace around the world. The force
       is driven by Sri Sri&#39;s vision of a stress-free and violence-free world and hence the
       urgent need for an Action for Peace.</p>
       
       <p>War or any other kind of disaster leaves behind a population that is constantly
       living in fear, anxiety and a sense of betrayal. There is an intense feeling of hatred and revenge inside them. The Art of Living Foundation, in its pursuit of Action for Peace, conducts special courses to release all these stresses and view life with a fresh, rejuvenated perspective. The perpetrators and victims are both treated with equal compassion. Action for Peace aims to bring people from diverse backgrounds to live together in harmony.</p>
       
       <h3>Sri Sri - Peace Mediator</h3>
       
       <p>Sri Sri has played the role of a peace mediator for countries in a deadlock. By
       bringing together conflicting parties on the negotiating table, these have defused
       violent situations. The Art of Living Foundation also brings together people of different faiths and cultures, to promote inter-faith harmony.Read more </p>
       
       <h3>Trauma Relief</h3>
       
       <p>“Stress and tension are the root cause of violence,” says Sri Sri. When stress is
       released from the system, peace results in the mind and human values such as cooperation,
       responsibility, friendliness and a sense of belongingness naturally develop.</p>
       
       <p>This understanding galvanizes our trauma relief workshops in times of disasters
       and war. War victims experience removal of fear, anxiety and betrayal. As a sense of inner peace
       prevails, feelings of hatred and revenge towards the perpetrators of violence are removed. Special
       courses are also held for perpetrators of violence, so that they view society from a larger vision.
       This has transformed terrorists and militants who have given up the path of violence.Read more </p>
       
       <h3>Sustainable Peace</h3>
       
       <p>The Art of Living Foundation promotes a sense of belongingness among thousands
       of people across the globe. This has brought together people of diverse backgrounds,
       reduced prejudices and created harmonious understanding between people of different nations.  </p>

	<h1>Sahaj Samadhi Meditation </h1>

	 <cite>Effortless path to true relaxation through Sahaj Samadhi Meditation</cite>
	   
	   <p>Everyone has experienced a meditative state in moments of deep joy, or when completely engrossed in an activity, when just for a moment the mind becomes so light and at ease. While we have such moments, we are unable to repeat them at will. The Sahaj Samadhi course teaches you how. This meditation technique almost instantly alleviates the practitioner from stress-related problems, deeply relaxes the mind and rejuvenates the system.</p>
	   
	   <p>Sahaj is a Sanskrit word that means natural or effortless. Samadhi is a deep, blissful, meditative state. Sahaj Samadhi meditation is a natural, effortless system of meditation.
	   Regular practise of the technique can totally transform the quality of one&#39;s life, by culturing the system to maintain the peace, energy and expanded awareness throughout the day. These meditation techniques combined with yogic practises can ensure good health and a calm mind.</p>
	   <ul>
	   
	       <li>Meditation allows the conscious mind to settle deeply in the Self, giving it rest</li>
	       <li>When the mind settles down, it lets go of all tension, making one healthy and focused</li>
	   
	   </ul>
	   <h3>How does Sahaj Samadhi Meditation work?</h3>
	   
	   <p>The participant is taught to use a simple sound mentally which allows the mind to settle down and go within. When the mind and nervous system are allowed to repose a few moments in the profound silence, the blocks that clog the system and our progress gradually dissolve.</p>
	   
	   <h3>How does reposing in the self help in day-to-day life</h3>
	   
	   <p>When a river is calm, its reflection is clearer. When the mind is calm, there is greater clarity in the field of expression. Our powers of observation, perception and expression improve. As a result we are able to communicate effectively and clearly.</p>
	   
	   <h3>Why do I need a mantra?</h3>
	   
	   <p>In Sanskrit, a mantra is described as, &#34;Manana trayate iti mantra.&#34;. Iti Mantra is that which saves you from repetitiveness. A repetitive thought is a worry. Mantras help to free you from worries.</p>

		   <h1>Wisdom Series </h1>	
		<p>With humour and insight, Sri Sri Ravi Shankar has revived the profound knowledge from ancient sacred texts in the form of commentaries that make the wisdom easy to apply to daily modern life. Art of Living centres offer group study sessions based on viewing and discussing these commentaries. The commentaries are also available for purchase from the Art of Living Bookstore in audio and video.</p>
	   
	   <h3>Ashtavakra Gita</h3>
	   
	   <p>One of the most enlightening discourses on the nature of reality.</p>
	   
	   <p>The Ashtavakra Gita illuminates an ancient conversation between the sage Ashtavakra and Janaka, a king with both worldly responsibilities and deep spiritual questioning about the nature of reality. &#34;What is real?&#34; Janaka asks. So begins one of the most unique conversations to ever take place on this planet, as Ashtavakra takes Janaka by the hand and leads him step by step into deeper levels of understanding until enlightenment dawns. Sri Sri&#39;s commentary unlocks this ancient wisdom so that it can come alive in our modern lives.</p>
	   
	   <h3>Narada Bhakti Sutras</h3>
	   
	   <p>Inspiration and practical insights to the seeker of truth.</p>
	   
	   <p>The blossoming of love for the Divine is called Bhakti. In an exceptional translation of the original text of the Bhakti Sutras, cognized by the ancient sage Narada, Sri Sri explores the unfolding (or awakening) and ecstasy of Divine Love.</p>
	   
	   <h3>Patanjali Yoga Sutras</h3>
	   
	   <p>The authoritative text on the mechanics of the growth of consciousness.</p>
	   <p>
	   Sri Sri translates and interprets the ancient Yoga Sutras of Maharishi Patanjali and brings to light the profound wisdom contained in Patanjali&#39;s Sanskrit passages. He explains how we can apply this knowledge in our everyday experiences and identifies practical techniques that Patanjali gives for realising union with the Divine. </p>
