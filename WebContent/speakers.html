			<div id="bio">
				<p>Sudhir Hasija, son of a government clerk left his home in
					Meerut, and moved to Hyderabad where he spent three years in a
					machine tools company and saved around Rs 3,000. He used this money
					to set up a business selling TV accessories such as antennas and
					trolleys in Chennai. It was a difficult struggle. He used to wash
					at railway stations and stay in low-cost lodges. However he
					persisted and managed to built a thriving business that he expanded
					across other southern cities.</p>
				<p>In 1996, when the pager and mobile phone revolution first
					started in Karnataka, Hasija bagged a contract to become the
					telecom hardware distributor for Alcatel-Lucent , soon he ended up
					as a distributor for Nokia, and then Samsung.Then 3 years back when
					many Indian companies started to make their own handsets to tap the
					country&#39;s booming mobile handset market, he gave up Samsung in
					2009 to start his own mobile phone brand Karbonn.</p>

				<p>Karbonn now has a market share of 4.5% in India. This is how
					Hasija explains his success:&#34;I understood the psyche of Indian
					population such as value for money and attraction towards
					innovation.&#34;</p>
