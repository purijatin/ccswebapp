    <h1>Disaster Relief</h1>
	<p>With its worldwide network of volunteers, the Art of Living
	Foundation is often able to respond swiftly to disasters anywhere
	in the world, providing physical and mental relief as well as
	material aid. Through this network, The Art of Living Foundation has established itself
	as one of the vital providers of disaster rehabilitation programmes the world over.</p>
	
	<p>The Art of Living Foundation,along with its sister organisations,
	The International Association for Human Values (IAHV) and Vyakti
	Vikas Kendra India (VVKI),has taken upon itself the responsibility of rehabilitating
	societies affected by violence and other natural disasters.</p>
	
	<p>From extensive relief and rehabilitation work in the tsunami-affected areas to earthquake
	relief in Gujarat, volunteers from The Art of Living Foundation
	have gone beyond their own safety concerns to attend to the mental, emotional and material
	needs of victims of these disasters.</p>
	
	<h3> Immediate Material Aid And Service </h3>
	<p>
	 The Art of Living provides emergency services and material
	 aid in the aftermath of disasters. These include food, clothes,
	 medicine and shelter. Doctors, counsellors and other physical and mental
	 health experts form an integral part of such immediate relief efforts.
	</p>
	   
	   
	 <h3> Near-Term Trauma Relief </h3>
	 <p> For survivors ofdisasters, who have experienced severe
	 physical and emotional trauma, material help alone is not sufficient.
	 Alleviating the trauma and helping people to reclaim their lives is essential. A study on
	 The Art of Living Trauma Relief Programs which were delivered to large
	 groups of South-East Asian tsunami survivors showed significant relief from post-traumatic stress disorder in only four days.</p>
	 
	 
	 <h3> Long-Term Rehabilitation</h3>
	 <p> True relief can only happen when disaster survivors are
	 completely rehabilitated - physically and emotionally, on both a personal and
	 societal level. People also need to have a sustainable means of earning their livelihood.
	 To achieve this, our volunteers work in villages and with local communities,
	 building homes, sanitation systems, roads, schools, vocational training centers and other necessary infrastructure. </p>

    <h1>Free Education</h1>
    
       <h4>A Revolution for Education</h4>
       <h4>Free School Education Program</h4>
       <p>Ved Vignan Maha Vidhya Peeth (VVMVP) was the first rural school started
       by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar in 1981. It started when Sri Sri observed some local children
       playing in the dust near The Art of Living Centre. When he saw that they had
       no access to education he decided to do something to help them.</p>
       
       <p>A local volunteer was appointed to look after the
       children to give them basic lessons in hygiene, teach them
       educational games and to serve them free healthy food for lunch.
       This became a big attraction for the children and their parents, and continues to date. As the school has progressed, a
       formal educational structure has been established and the number of students and teachers has increased.</p>
       
       <p>Today this school has become a model for 209 similar free schools that are revolutionizing education in rural and tribal India.</p>
       
       <h3>First Generation Students</h3>
       
       <p>Almost 95&#37; of the students are first generation and the school is proud to have a 100&#37;
       success rate in local exams </p>
       
	<p>&#8220;At this young age my daughter would have been working in the farms.
	We never dreamt of her getting an education! I am so happy to see her going to school!&#8221; - Mrs Savitri, a parent</p>

	<h3>Stress-free School</h3>
	
	<p>The students are provided with uniforms, shoes, books, writing materials, bus service and
	mid-day meals to neutralize any factors that can prevent them from attending school. Yoga, meditation,
	sports and creative activities like dance, music, drawing and painting form an essential part of the school
	curriculum to ensure a healthy body and mind.</p>
	
	<p>
	The Art of Living course for children, ART Excel ,
	is organised regularly for students to help them to handle any negative
	influences at home. Outdoor medical facilities and a mobile dispensary are also made available. </p>
	
	<p>In order to make students more aware of the political system and inculcate leadership skills in them, the school has its own cabinet. The school children themselves elect the school cabinet. Through this system, children learn the importance of the Indian democratic system of governance in a practical way. The school cabinet takes responsibility for the junior classes and helps with the running of the school.</p>
	
	<h3>Developing Communities</h3>
	
	<p>Emphasizing girl&#39;s education and women empowerment, senior students are also
	taught vocational skills like tailoring, computer training and carpentry and encouraged
	to pursue secondary education.</p>
	
	<p>To maintain the bond between former students and the school, alumni meetings have recently
	started. Alumni share their experiences with other students and encouraging them to pursue secondary
	education and their goals.</p>
	
	<p>The alumni group holds regular meetings with parents and children to raise awareness about the importance of education.</p>

	<h1>Freedom Behind Bars </h1>
	
	<h3>Prison SMART Program</h3>
	
	<p>&#34;If people get sick, we take them to the hospital and give them the
	right medicine to get better. If people&#39;s behaviour is sick, we bring them to
	the prison, but we forget the medicines.&#34; &#45; Sri Sri Ravi Shankar</p>
	
	<h3>The Mission</h3>
	
	<p>The Prison SMART Programme aims to transform the lives of people working
	in or incarcerated within the criminal justice system. Prison SMART teaches
	skills that reduce stress, heal trauma and provides practical knowledge of how
	to handle negative emotions in order to live to one&#39;s highest potential and contribute to society in a positive way.</p>
	
	<p>So far the lives of more than 3,50,000 prison inmates have been transformed through the &#39;Prison Smart&#39; programs</p>
	
	<h3>Basic Premise</h3>
	
	<p>The basic premise of the program is that no individual is really &#39;bad&#39; but
	takes to crime due to external stressors which they are unable to deal with effectively.</p>

	<h1>Environmental Care </h1>

	 <p>he Art of Living Foundation, with its roots in spirituality, has nurtured a deep
	 respect for our planet in thousands of people around the world. The earth may be made up of rocks,
	 sand and water, but spirituality can help us to perceive our planet as a
	 living vibrant entity, responding to our care and attention.</p>
	 
	 <p>Inspired by the vision of Sri Sri Ravi Shankar and moving together as a team,
	 volunteers from around the world have initiated several environmental projects: Large
	 scale tree plantations through Mission Green Earth, water conservation and protection including
	 cleaning polluted rivers and zero-budget chemical-free farming which support poorer farmers to farm to
	 farm in a way which is both economically and organically sound.</p>
	 
	 <p>The Art of Living Foundation also recognises that to nurture and ensure future conservation
	 of nature, it is necessary that these values be inculcated in young minds at home and at school.
	 Awareness programes for young people and children (called ‘Deepening Roots, Broadening Vision’) also
	 form an important and integral part of this long-term programme.</p>

       <h1>Peace</h1>  
       
       <cite>&#34;The past years have been very challenging in the world scenario.
       We have seen a number of agitations flaring up almost everywhere. It is easy to create an agitation
       in today&#39;s society. The frustration & stress levels are high. Any just cause
       can flare up emotions and get people onto the streets.
       
       However, it is a much more challenging and skillful task to create inner
       peace and have people stand up in a peaceful, non-violent and happy mode to
       work towards collective, constructive action.</cite><cite>
       
       The Art of Living has made a humble effort all over the world where millions
       of people have stood up for change in this direction. Today, I am happy that
       people are embracing meditation as well as acknowledging the role of inner peace in nation building.&#34;
       
       - Sri Sri Ravi Shankar </cite>
       
       <p>Since its inception in 1981, the Art of Living&#39;s founder, Sri Sri Ravi
       Shankar has been engaged in a peace mission. Here, in The Art of Living Foundation,
       spirituality gives strength and responsibility to serve society. The passion and
       energy stem from the realisation of the need for peace around the world. The force
       is driven by Sri Sri&#39;s vision of a stress-free and violence-free world and hence the
       urgent need for an Action for Peace.</p>
       
       <p>War or any other kind of disaster leaves behind a population that is constantly
       living in fear, anxiety and a sense of betrayal. There is an intense feeling of hatred and revenge inside them. The Art of Living Foundation, in its pursuit of Action for Peace, conducts special courses to release all these stresses and view life with a fresh, rejuvenated perspective. The perpetrators and victims are both treated with equal compassion. Action for Peace aims to bring people from diverse backgrounds to live together in harmony.</p>
       
       <h3>Sri Sri - Peace Mediator</h3>
       
       <p>Sri Sri has played the role of a peace mediator for countries in a deadlock. By
       bringing together conflicting parties on the negotiating table, these have defused
       violent situations. The Art of Living Foundation also brings together people of different faiths and cultures, to promote inter-faith harmony.Read more </p>
       
       <h3>Trauma Relief</h3>
       
       <p>&#34;Stress and tension are the root cause of violence,&#34; says Sri Sri. When stress is
       released from the system, peace results in the mind and human values such as cooperation,
       responsibility, friendliness and a sense of belongingness naturally develop.</p>
       
       <p>This understanding galvanizes our trauma relief workshops in times of disasters
       and war. War victims experience removal of fear, anxiety and betrayal. As a sense of inner peace
       prevails, feelings of hatred and revenge towards the perpetrators of violence are removed. Special
       courses are also held for perpetrators of violence, so that they view society from a larger vision.
       This has transformed terrorists and militants who have given up the path of violence.Read more </p>
       
       <h3>Sustainable Peace</h3>
       
       <p>The Art of Living Foundation promotes a sense of belongingness among thousands
       of people across the globe. This has brought together people of diverse backgrounds,
       reduced prejudices and created harmonious understanding between people of different nations.  </p>

	 <h1>Women and Child Care </h1>
	 
	 <p>Women face many social challenges today whether it be making soaps and incence in order
	 to secure an income for her family to raising children amidst the harsh economic crisis. A woman
	 is dynamic in the many roles she plays. In the village of Warwarhere in Maharashtra 400 women stood
	 up and raised their voices to ban alcohol and
	 drugs. Women have withstood perennial health problems due to the lack of toilet facilites and
	 are forced to use fields and open spaces for defecation.</p>
	 
	 <p>The Art of Living empowers women to face the present challenges by providing tools and techniques
	 that help to eliminate individual stress. A sense of community spirit is created that allows for women
	 to face these similar challenges as a team rather than individually. The Art of Living encourages women
	 to find practical solutions to their challenges so that each one becomes self-dependent in their own right.</p>
